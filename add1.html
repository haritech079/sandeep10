        <h3>Climate strike of November 2015</h3>
        <p>In late-November 2015, an independent group of students invited other students around the world to skip school on the first day of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. On 30 November, the first day of the conference, a "Climate strike" was organised in over 100 countries; over 50000 people participated.[5] The movement focused on three demands: 100% clean energy; keeping fossil fuels in the ground, and helping climate refugees.[6]</p>
